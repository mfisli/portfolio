## Remote Updates To Business Phones

While working at Voxter in the telecommunication industry, we had a small team of technicians that would handle setting up and troubleshooting business phones. One issue was travel time. It was not cost effective to have a technician drive out to a site and do a small task, especially if it was multiple times a day. A common task was provisioning a phone and assigning custom action for programmable buttons. A custom action could include the quick dialing of a number or listing the directory of a department.

To reduce the need for travel time for small tasks, we developed a remote provisioning phone application called KeyMan. The application was built using an Angular front end that talked to a PHP back end. After release, our technicians were very happy that they could now see the current configuration of a phone and commit updates without having to get up from their office chair. I was a great time saver. Clients that phoned in with questions or requests for provisioning changes were surprised that we could now make live changes to their phone almost immediately.
