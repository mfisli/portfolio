## 100 Players In A Single WWI Map

See the project live here: <a href="https://playbtw.com/" target="_blank">Beyond The Wire</a>

Beyond the Wire is a large-scale multiplayer first-person shooter in the frantic and bloody western front of the great war that is developed by Offworld Industries. It features authentic maps, classic weapons, and brutal melee combat. Up to 100 players can take part in a single map.

The marketing and community teams needed a way to drive sales and keep players updated on features and exciting new content. The majority of the work was completed with an external agency. The site was built using Forestry CMS and Eleventy.

My role was to implement new features, such as expanding the CMS tool to handle draft posts so that news posts could be written and saved, but not visible to the public until they were ready. I also improved the functionality of the image sliders to correctly handle aspect ratios of images and text overflow.
