## 100 Players In A Single WWI Map

Beyond the Wire is a large scale multiplayer first-person shooter in the frantic and bloody western front of the great war that is developed by Offworld Industries. It features authentic maps, classic weapons, and brutal melee combat. Up to 100 players can take part in a single map.

The marketing and community teams needed a way to drive sales and keep players updated on new features and process. The majority of the work was completed with an external agency. The site was built using Forestry and Eleventy. The home page has an eye catching video with clear call to action buttons. The features of the game and why it stands out are fleshed out. The news feature allows community managers who are not developers to compose and publish news posts to keep the players informed.

 My role was to implement new features, such as expanding the CMS tool to handle draft posts so that news posts could be written and saved, but not visible to the public until they were ready. I also improved the functionality of the image sliders to correcly handle aspect ratios of images and text overflow.
